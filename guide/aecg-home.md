# Introduction
Welcome to the Atlas Exandria Cartographer's Guide, a comprehensive document designed to help you take my maps of Exandria and truly make them your own. While the official maps of Exandria from the Tal'Dorei and Wildemount campaign guides are outstanding, they represent a version of the world that is influenced and shaped by the heroes in someone else's game. Let your imagination and the travels of your players mold and shape this wonderful world.

The purpose of the Atlas Exandria Cartographer's Guide, is to provide you with everything you need to open my maps, make changes, both big and small, and maintain a consistent look & feel. You can wipe Westruun off the face of the map, add a player-run town at the Silvercut Crossroads, or fill in the empty expanse that is most of Issylra. You can do whatever you want and your maps and mine will like they were always meant to go together.

## Guiding Principles
At the outset of this project, I set for myself a number of guiding principles for this project. These guiding principles are:

1. Wonderdraf source files shall be freely available for anyone to modify to suit their own needs.
1. All maps shall use stock assets & fonts included with Wonderdraft.
1. All maps shall be exported from Wonderdraft, with no post-processing in any external applications.
1. All images, code, documentation, and source files shall be 

## Wonderdraft

### General Settings
The following are the general map settings displayed on the right side of the screen when a specific tool has not been selected. These have significant impact on the overall look & feel of the maps.

### Landmass
#### Tracing
My technique for tracing is to use **brush size (5)** and **roughness (1.5)** and work slowly. I'll completely trace a coastline and then go back with varying sized brushes to fill in the interior.


## Color
For the Atlas Exandria maps, I decided to go with a realistic, less saturated color palette partially inspired by the old maps that came with some of my favorite computer RPGs.

### Technique
While using the same color palette will certainly help achieve a similar look as my maps, the real trick is to use the appropriate brush settings and painting technique.

To achieve the layered, textured look, you need to use the "grunge" brush, keep it large, and lower the opacity.  You then want to make multiple passes over areas to apply the color a little at a time. You want to use an especially light tough between biomes, to give it a more natural looking transition.

When you need to reduce the size of the brush to get into hard to reach places, make sure you lower the opacity even more and make small, quick strokes. The smaller
