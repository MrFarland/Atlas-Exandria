## Introduction
Atlas Exandria is a comprehensive geographical reference for the world of Exandria for 5th edition [Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com) game masters running "open world" campaigns & adventures in the [Critical Role](https://critrole.com) universe. Atlas Exandria is an interactive reference module for the [EncounterPlus](https://encounter.plus) virtual tabletop system available for Apple iOS and MacOS devices. 

### What is EncounterPlus?
[EncounterPlus](https://encounter.plus) is an advanced Virtual Tabletop (VTT) application for the 5th edition of the popular tabletop RPG system Dungeons & Dragons. It was designed to help Dungeon masters run combat encounters more easily, track initiative, health, statistics and conditions seamlessly and efficiently. It is available for iOS and Mac devices.

### What is an EncounterPlus Module?
A module is a collection of pages, encounters, and maps that can be quickly and easily imported into EncounterPlus. They can be reference materials, adventures, or any number of tools that can help run a D&D session more efficiently. 


This module was conceived, designed, and developed for the purpose of supporting my personal campaigns & adventures in the world of Exandria. As such, this module was created for:

- **[EncounterPlus](https://encounter.plus)**: Atlas Exandria is, first & foremost, a module for the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop system available for Apple iOS & MacOS devices. There will be an offline PDF version of this atlas, but it will lack many of the capabilities it was created for.
- **[Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com) (5th Edition)**: While you may be able to use this module for your Pathfinder or other preferred tabletop role-playing game system, the module was created specifically for DnD5e.
- **Game Masters**: The Atlas Exandria was created for game masters running campaigns & adventures in Exandria. It is not a reference for the [stream](https://critrole.com) or "[The Legend of Vox Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11247158/)". The goal is "canon consistency", not 100% canon.

## Goals
The following are the goals of this project.

1. **Maps (Wonderdraft)**: Source files for the world, continent, & region maps.
1. **Maps (Image)**: Digital images of each map 
1. **Module**: Interactive atlas module for the EncounterPlus virtual tabletop.
1. **Offline Atlas**: An offline, non-interactive version of the atlas in PDF format.
1. **Cartographer's Guide**: Documentation on conventions used to create the maps.
